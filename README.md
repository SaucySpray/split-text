-------------------------

Creating mesh is acheived by defining a geometry and a material, see [how to create a mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh). And it's the same for our elements here (masks, cylinders, and gltf models), except that GLTF models need a GLTF loader, the [THREEJS.GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader) works well, but since we are using webpack, it's easier to use [this custom loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-gltf-loader).
